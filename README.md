# **What is RFM Analysis?**
RFM analysis is a technique for categorizing customers based on their purchasing behavior. This segmentation method allows marketing teams to target customers with personalized marketing campaigns. Instead of analyzing the entire customer base as a whole, it's better to segment them into homogenous groups, understand the traits of each group, and engage them with relevant campaigns.

RFM stands for **R**ecency, **F**requency, and **M**onetary value. That means we have to use these metrics in order to perform this method. So what are these values?
* **Recency** : The freshness of customer activity. It's the time difference between the last purchase date of the customer and the date of analysis.
* **Frequency** : The frequency of the customer transaction, means a total number of transactions.
* **Monetary** : Sum of each purchase that has been made by each customer.
